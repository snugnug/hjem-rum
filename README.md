A module collection for managing your `$HOME` with [Hjem].

## A brief explanation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hjem, the tooling Hjem Rum is built off of, is still unfinished. Use at your
> own risk, and beware of bugs, issues, and missing features. If you do not feel
> like being a beta tester, wait until Hjem is more finished. It is not yet
> ready to fully replace Home Manager in the average user's config, but if you
> truly want to, an option could be to use both in conjunction. Either way, as
> Hjem continues to be developed, Hjem Rum will be worked on as we build modules
> and functionality out to support average users.

Based on the Hjem tooling, Hjem Rum (literally meaning "home rooms") is a
collection of modules for various programs and services to simplify the use of
Hjem for managing your `$HOME` files.

Hjem was initially created as an improved implementation of the `home`
functionality that Home Manager provides. Its purpose was minimal. Hjem Rum's
purpose is to create a module collection based on that tooling in order to
recreate the functionality that Home Manager's large collection of modules
provides, allowing you to simply install and config a program.

## Setup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As mentioned above, Hjem is unstable software, which means that there will be
> API breakage in case of version mismatches between your flake's version and
> Hjem Rum's, as we test our code against the version of Hjem currently in
> `flake.lock`.
>
> As such, we recommend flake users to follow our Hjem input (an example is
> given below).
>
> This will guarantee that our modules will evaluate and work as intended, but
> it also means that you will also not get the newest and freshest options from
> Hjem, as we do update the input rather cautiously.

To start using Hjem Rum, you must first import the flake and its modules into
your system(s):

```nix
# flake.nix
inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    # We recommend following our Hjem input
    hjem.follows = "hjem-rum/hjem";

    # You can also manage your own Hjem version, but this may come with breakage (read the admonition above)
    # hjem = {
    #     url = "github:feel-co/hjem";
    #     # You may want hjem to use your defined nixpkgs input to
    #     # minimize redundancies.
    #     inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    # };
    hjem-rum = {
        url = "github:snugnug/hjem-rum";
        # You may want hjem-rum to use your defined nixpkgs input to
        # minimize redundancies.
        inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
        # Same goes for hjem, to avoid discrepancies between the version
        # you use directly and the one hjem-rum uses.
        inputs.hjem.follows = "hjem";
    };
};

# One example of importing the module into your system configuration
outputs = {
    self,
    nixpkgs,
    ...
} @ inputs: {
    nixosConfigurations = {
        default = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
            specialArgs = {inherit inputs;};
            modules = [
                # Import the hjem module
                inputs.hjem.nixosModules.default
                # Whatever other modules you are importing
            ];
        };
    };
}
```

Be sure to first set the necessary settings for Hjem and import the Hjem module
from the input:

```nix
# configuration.nix
hjem = {
    # Importing the modules
    extraModules = [
        inputs.hjem-rum.hjemModules.default
    ];
    # Configuring your user(s)
    users.<username> = {
        enable = true;
        directory = "/home/<username>";
        user = "<username>";
    };
    # You should probably also enable clobberByDefault at least for now.
    clobberByDefault = true;
};
```

You can then configure any of the options defined in this flake in any nix
module:

```nix
# configuration.nix
hjem.users.<username>.rum.programs.alacritty = {
    enable = true;
    #package = pkgs.alacritty; # Default
    settings = {
        window = {
            dimensions = {
                lines = 28;
                columns = 101;
            };
            padding = {
                x = 6;
                y = 3;
            };
        };
    };
}
```

> [!TIP]

## Environmental Variables

Hjem provides attribute set "environment.sessionVariables" that allows the user
to set environmental variables to be sourced. However, Hjem does not have the
capability to actually source them. This can be done manually, which is what
Hjem Rum tries to do.

Currently, some of our modules may add environmental variables (such as our GTK
module), but cannot load them without the use of another module. Currently,
modules that load environmental variables include:

- [programs/fish]
- [programs/zsh]
- [programs/nushell]
- [desktops/hyprland]

If you are either using something like our GTK module, or are manually adding
variables to `environment.sessionVariables`, but are neither loading those
variables manually, or using one of the above modules, those variables will not
be loaded, and may cause unintended problems. For example, GTK applications may
not respect your theme, as some rely on the environmental variable to actually
use the theme you declare.

Please see [#17] for status on providing support for shells and compositors. If
your shell or compositor is on listed there, please leave a comment and it will
be added. You are encouraged to open a PR to help support your shell or
compositor if possible.
